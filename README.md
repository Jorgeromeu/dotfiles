# dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files for **vim**, **tmux** and **zsh** and many other programs. Even though it is public, this repo is not really intended to be replicated. You _can_ if you want but It is mostly set up to meet my needs.

# usage

To make setting up on a new machine easy, the setup works like so:

- Clone the repo and place it in your home directory (~/dotfiles)
- Now, instead of storing your config files in their "intended locations" create a symbolic link from the location to the same file in this repo. For example from `~/.vimrc -> ~/dotfiles/nvim/minimal.vim`.
