# dotfiles

This configuration contains my config files for a collection of programs but mainly **vim**, **tmux** and **zsh**.

## TODO

This repository is constantly evolving, the following need to be implemented/fixed:

- **shell**
  - add a basic bashrc (for systems whre installing zsh is a hassle)
  - re-organize the shell folder

- **vim**
  - ignore plugged in repo 
  - ignore view history in repo
  - add better support for differentiating prose and code
  - simplify configuration (prune plugins)

- **tmux**
  - look into [tmux better mouse mode](https://github.com/NHDaly/tmux-better-mouse-mode)
