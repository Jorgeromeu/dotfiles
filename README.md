## Vim/Neovim

This repository contains three different configurations. Their respective vimrc's are:

- `nvim/bloated.vim` my main configuration which I use on my local machine. 
- `nvim/minimal.vim` a stripped down version which maintains some small plugins with no dependencies 
- `nvim/hybrid.vim` a barebones vanilla configuration with zero plugins

Changing the configuration can be done by sourcing the correct file in the system vimrc file. The repository includes the script `changeconfig` for automating this
